# Project Garage

Project Garage is a pseudo-database for storing automobile models, running statistical analyses on them, and simulating a race. The main edition will be written in C++, with possible versions written in Python and/or Java.
The current edition only runs as a command-line application, with no GUI or persistent data.

## Installation
Just download the files, will make a Tar.gz later for easy downloading


## Building
There will be a makefile with build commands later.
We will start with `make tests` and `make db`, as our first simple commands


## Testing
For now we just have a bare-bones unit test framework using assert statements and printing.



## Usage

On startup, you will just run a .exe from the command line, and will be shown a startup message.

### Commands 

```Coming soon!
```




## Contributing
Right now we are still working on the first working version, and working out the potential bugs and kinks in the UI.
After the first version is completed, we will open up for contributors.
