## Project Garage

Project Garage is a pseudo-database for storing automobile models, running statistical analyses on them, and simulating a race. The main edition will be written in C++, with possible versions written in Python and/or Java.
The current edition only runs as a command-line application, with no GUI or persistent data. The main purpose of this project is to strengthen knowledge of C++, OOP principles, and file inpu/output management.

### Installation
We will make a Tar.gz later for easy downloading when we have a stable build. For now just download the files or clone the directory.

### Building
There will be a makefile with build commands later.
We will start with `make tests` and `make garage`, as our first simple commands.


### Testing
We are making our own unit test files with the C assert library. The two test files right now are testCars.cpp and testGarage.cpp, which cover most functionality.


### Usage

On startup, you will just run './garage' from the command line, and will be shown a startup message.

### Commands 

```
Coming soon!
```




## Contributing
Right now we are still working on the first working version, and working out the potential bugs and kinks in the UI.
After the first version is completed, we will open up for contributors.
